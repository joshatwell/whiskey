If you're traveling with bottles here are some suggestions:
* Grab one of the "bottle diapers" or "Jet Bags" http://amzn.com/B004FLK2IU
* You have to check your bag with this amount of liquid.
* I've checked a bag with 6 750ml bottles in my suitcase without issue.
* You are subject to TSA inspection when you have bottles in your bag.
* If you don't have a "Jet Bag" I recommend wrapping the bottle in jeans and surrounding with other clothes.
* Whe packing consider that your bag may be dropped and will be placed "face down" on conveyors.
* If you're planning on buying multiple bottles and worry about suitcase space, consider traveling with a small duffle to carry "overflow" clothing as a carry on. Also good to do this or put extra pair of clothes in backpack in event of lost luggage.
