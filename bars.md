# Atlanta
Park Bar - Nice whiskey offering

# Boulder, CO
* West End Tavern - Excellent flights
* Bitter Bar - Best cocktails in Boulder
* Bramble and Hare - Also great cocktails
* Canyon's Restaurant - Has had a lot of turnover. YMMV

# Denver, CO  
**Bull and Bush - Cherry Creek Area**
Awesome selection - ask for the off-menu menu.  Lots of Four Roses, and they do their own barrel selects. <- @vTexan

# Detroit, MI
**Townhouse Detroit**
This place was so much more amazing than I was expecting. The bourbon selection was phenomenal. In fact, I was able to try a few different ones that I had not seen anywhere else such as Colonol E.H. Taylor Cured Oak. They also offer some phenomenal flights. I grabbed the BTAC (Buffalo Trace Antique Collection) flight for 90 bucks. Was a great evening and I will be going back.

**The Whiskey Parlor**
I added this one because if you're in Detroit and you see Townhouse you'll notice this place a block away. After being at Townhouse I'd simply skip Whiskey Parlor unless you're wanting a more intimate atmosphere. The selection was not as good and neither were the prices. Go here for quieter atmosphere and smaller bites, not for exploring whiskey.

# London, UK
**Barbecoa St. Paul's**
This Jamie Oliver restaurant had a surprisingly great Bourbon selection. I had the opportunity to get a 1973 10 year old Wild Turkey and direct compare it to a modern pour of Wild Turkey. The other nice part about this place is that their pours are a more traditional American pour versus the 25/50ml pours you typically get in the UK. Food and view were both excellent.

# Louisville, KY
**Jeff Ruby's Steakhouse**
OK. This place is one of many Jeff Ruby's Steakhouses, but I'm telling you it was one of the finer dining experiences I've had. The food was delicious and the cocktails were on point. Try the brussel sprouts. I promise you'll thank me.

**DISH on Market**
We really enjoyed the drinks and the bone marrow starter here. Bartenders take care in their cocktails. Great spot for starting the night and only a short walk from numerous restaurants and other bars.

**Butchertown Grocery**
This place feels like you're in the wrong place, but the bar on top of the restaurant is fantastic. Great views of the city and excellent cocktails. They didn't flinch at any of my drink requests. We walked there. Uber or Taxi is a better idea :-)

# Las Vegas, NV

**The Whiskey Attic**
This one is a little trickier. To visit this place you need to get a group and set up an appointment. Visiting includes a great tasting based on your flavor preferences. It's about $100/person and worth it for a great tasting experience.
They also boast having the largest whiskey collection in the world. I don't doubt it. Just check out my twitter header image to see what they have! Admittedly the location seems counterintuitive, but you'll have to trust me. They also have an amazing beer selection.

**Rose. Rabbit. Lie - Cosmopolitan**
Great atmosphere. Live music. Great bartenders.
They should know how to make a quality Brooklyn and Sazerac.

**RX Boiler Room - Mandalay Bay**
The bartenders here know their craft. My favorite place to go at Mandalay Bay

**1923 Bourbon and Burlesque - Mandalay Bay**
Only open over the weekend, but worth stopping in. Atmosphere is generally cool unless there are a ton of people smoking. Drinks were decent, but I've not been there during regular hours. Just during corporate private events. Opinion still under evaluation.

# Pittsburgh
**Butcher and Rye** 
Great selection and the bartenders know their craft.

# Toronto, ON
**The Merchant**
Owner is lover of whiskey. Does very cool barrel-aged old fashioned and manhattans.

# West Palm Beach, FL
**Blue Martini**
The old fashioned they made me included a rock candy stick. It was a cool way to include the sugar. Given how my evening there went I'm sure they pour heavy. Keep that in mind if you determine you don't like their cocktails. :-)
