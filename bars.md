# Atlanta
Park Bar - Nice whiskey offering

# Boulder, CO
West End Tavern - Excellent flights

# Las Vegas, NV

The Whiskey Attic
This one is a little trickier. To visit this place you need to get a group and set up an appointment. Visiting includes a great tasting based on your flavor preferences. It's about $100/person and worth it for a great tasting experience.
They also boast having the largest whiskey collection in the world. I don't doubt it. Just check out my twitter header image to see what they have! Admittedly the location seems counterintuitive, but you'll have to trust me. They also have an amazing beer selection.
