I like whiskey, and whisky depending on where it's from. I generally drink bourbon but I'm equal opportunity. This repo is where I'll keep some notes on the Whiskey that I have, have tried, still want to obtain, etc. Over time I may even get clever and start organizing them in meaningful ways for both myself and for you. Open to suggestions! Cheers!

Opinions on spirits vary, but I"ll consider this an outline based on MY preferences, in case you wondered what I liked to drink. I'll put the ones that make me smile the most in **bold**.

Finally, I don't have a drinking problem. I have a whiskey buying problem. Drinking problem means your recycle bin is full. My problem means I need a bigger liquor cabinet. :-)
